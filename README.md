Dave asked me to write a script to watch a certain webpage and a certain twitter feed for the mention of a certain beer being
tapped, so I threw this together. It's crappy, but it seems to be working.

Next time I'll put stuff in a library folder and write an autoloader or use composer.
I don't really know why that interface is there either, it would probably be better to inherit from a base class.

Also I'm using Stephen Morleys class.Diff.php, which you can find more about at http://code.stephenmorley.org/php/diff-implementation/
